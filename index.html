		<p>
			<strong>The National</strong> are a Brooklyn-based band where baritone vocalist Matt Berninger 
			is flanked by two pairs of brothers, guitarists/composers Aaron and Bryce Dessner, 
			and rhythm-section Scott and Bryan Devendorf. <br>
			<q>It's not like I have a pair of Gallaghers on each side,</q> says Berninger. 
			<q>I think it's a great thing, actually, that we have such a history, 
			which is something that might be rare for five guys in a band.</q>
			<br>
			The National's long history was a slow, steady progression; 
			which echoes the patience listeners often need to bring to their melancholy, sorrowful, 
			stately rock music. They began as unknowns, something that didn't change until the release 
			of their third album, <em>Alligator</em>. Their real breakout came with 2007's <em>Boxer</em>, 
			whose rousing finale <em>Fake Empire</em> was used in Barack Obama's 2008 election campaign.

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				Though they've spent their entire life based in New York, The National's roots 
				trace back to Cincinnati, where Berninger and Scott Devendorf played in a band called <em>Nancy</em>, 
				and Bryan and the Dessners played in <em>Project Nim</em>. Berninger was already living in New York 
				when Aaron recruited him to work on a new project, but the first recordings 
				took place in Cincinnati, though they were made not within the prism of the band.
				<br>
				They called this new collective <em>The National</em>. <q>We were trying to find a name 
				that didn't mean anything. That was sort of devoid of any kind of interpretation 
				and wasn't overly clever,</q> Berninger told <em>Scenestar</em>. <q>But, in Germany, 
				we actually had some shows boycotted because they thought we were in 
				someway affiliated with the right wing conservative neo-Nazi party.</q>

			<h2>Beginnings</h2>
			<p>
				2001's <em>The National</em>, the band's debut, was the sound of its members 
				<q>introducing ourselves to each another</q>, Berninger told Drowned in <em>Sound</em>. 
				<q>We didn't know what kind of record we'd make or band we'd be; 
				not even a notion of being, say, an Americana band despite the slide guitar on it. 
				So that was like, 'hey, we can make songs together and some of these are great'.</q>
				<br>
				Where they went was out on the road, putting their careers &#45; as graphic and web designers 
				on the dot-com bubble &#45; on hold to suffer through touring in anonymity. 
				<q>We thought having a record meant that you can go out and tour the world</q>,
				Berninger recalled. <q>We only came to realise that having a record doesn't automatically 
				mean people are going to know who you are when we played hundreds of empty shows. 
				We actually played one show in Orange County, California, where there was literally 
				no one in the venue except for the staff.</q>

			<h2>Breakout</h2>
			<p>
				The National's first album for Beggars Banquet, 2005's <i>Alligator</i>, 
				proved to be their breakout. Afforded more exposure by dint of being signed to the influential indie, 
				The National entrenched their European audience, and, having quit their jobs to focus of the band, 
				toured hard at home. <q><em>Alligator</em> was filled with anxiety and I'm sure quitting our 
				jobs was one of the sources of that,</q> Berninger would offer, to <em>Sixeyes</em>. 
				<q>The 2004 presidential campaign was also a factor.</q>
				<br>
				A presidential campaign would soon play a huge part in The National's upward career arc. 
				<em>Boxer</em> &#45;<q>we think it's our best record,</q> Berninger boasted &#45; arrived in 2007 to a chorus of critical acclaim, 
				including a career-making 8.6 score on <em>Pitchfork</em>. Featuring collaborations/orchestrations with Sufjan Stevens, 
				it was a richly-orchestrated record that slowly built up to the outbursting fanfare of <em>Fake Empire.</em>
				<br>
				In 2008, the song would be used by the election campaign for Barack Obama, 
				its fanfare now trumpeting Hope and Change; its eventual destiny to play at the Democratic National Convention. 
				After <em>Alligator</em> seethed at the state of Bush-era America, the changing optimism at play on <em>Boxer</em> &#45; 
				and tours with R.E.M. and <em>Modest Mouse</em> &#45; helped them connect to a far wider audience.

			<h2>Developments</h2>
			<p>
				Tasked with following-up <em>Boxer</em>, and recording for new label 4AD &#45; perhaps the most iconic imprint in indie music
				&#45; The National found the going difficult. "We were in a very strange place," Aaron Dessner explained. 
				<q>We were, personally, not particularly happy with each other, touring on Boxer had gone on and on for two years.</q>
				<br>
				The result, <em>High Violet</em>, was an album of gauzy, reverb-riddled guitars out to capture a sonic texture the 
				band called 'loose wool'. <q>Matt wanted the sonic qualities to be dark, tar-like, devoid of light,</q> 
				said Bryan, <q>lots of hard-to-follow art direction</q>. It was also an album marked by creative tension.
				<br>
				<q>There is a certain amount of pain to it,</q> Bryan Devendorf said, of the record. 
				<q>Just by way of being a collective endeavour there are conflicts.</q> Offered Berninger, to <em>The Guardian</em>: 
				<q>We'll have heated debates over a flute line, a tambourine hit or a lyric. We'll go to war.</q>
				<br>
				Yet, when time came to tour <em>High Violet</em>, The National were met with a revelation: 
				outside of the claustrophobic cocoon of the studio &#45; where they'd made 100 different mixes 
				of the standout song <em>Lemonworld</em>&#45; the band's shows had become hugely celebratory. 
				The album had debuted in the Top 5 in the UK, US, and Canada, and now The National &#45;
				who, by that stage, were dealing with infant children &#45; were afforded the luxury of playing seated theaters 
				to large audiences. <q>The <em>High Violet</em> touring cycle turned out to be unexpectedly joyous, 
				it was actually fun, and by the end we were enjoying being in the band, 
				and felt very thankful for what we'd accomplished,</q> Aaron said.
				<br>
				This trickled on to the making of The National's sixth album, 2013's <em>Trouble Will Find Me</em>, 
				which the band described as 'freewheeling' and 'fun,' qualities not always associated 
				with the band's often stark, sombre music.
